# Functional Requirements for pdf_to_images.py

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the functional requirements for the `pdf_to_images.py` script. The primary purpose of this script is to convert PDF documents into a series of image files.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### REQ-P2I-001: PDF to Image Conversion
The system shall provide a capability to convert a given PDF file into one or more image files. Each page of the PDF shall be converted into a separate image.

### REQ-P2I-002: Input PDF Source
The conversion capability shall accept the content of the PDF file as a byte stream.

### REQ-P2I-003: Output Image Format
The system shall support configurable image formats for the output files. The default format shall be PNG. The format shall be specifiable via a parameter (e.g., 'png', 'jpeg').

### REQ-P2I-004: Image Resolution
The system shall allow specifying the resolution (DPI - dots per inch) for the output images. The default resolution shall be 300 DPI, specifiable via a parameter.

### REQ-P2I-005: Output Directory Management
REQ-P2I-005-1: If an output folder is not specified, the system shall automatically create a new directory to store the generated images.

REQ-P2I-005-2: The name of the auto-generated directory shall be derived from the original PDF's filename, appended with a unique timestamp to prevent naming conflicts. The format shall be `{pdf_name_base}_{timestamp}`.

REQ-P2I-005-3: If an output folder is specified, the system shall use the provided folder path. If the folder does not exist, it shall be created.

### REQ-P2I-006: Output File Naming
The individual image files generated from the PDF pages shall be named sequentially. The naming convention shall be `page_{i+1}.{fmt}`, where `i` is the zero-based index of the page.

### REQ-P2I-007: Return Value
The conversion capability shall return a tuple containing:

REQ-P2I-007-1: The path to the output folder where the images are saved.

REQ-P2I-007-2: A list of the full paths to each generated image file.

### REQ-P2I-008: Timestamp Generation
The system shall provide a capability to generate a unique timestamp string. The format shall be `HHMMSSDDMMYY`. This timestamp is used for creating unique output folder names as described in `REQ-P2I-005`.

### REQ-P2I-009: Script Execution
The script shall be executable as a standalone module. When executed directly, it should run a test case using a sample PDF file to demonstrate its functionality and verify its operation. The test case should read the PDF file, call the conversion function, and print the output folder and the list of generated files.

## 3. Implementation Details

The following table maps the functional requirements to the specific functions within the `pdf_to_images.py` script.

| Function Name             | Description                                                                                             | Related Requirements                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `convert_pdf_to_images`   | Converts PDF byte data into a series of images, handling output directory and file naming.              | REQ-P2I-001, 002, 003, 004, 005-1, 005-2, 005-3, 006, 007-1, 007-2, 009      |
| `get_timestamp`           | Generates a formatted timestamp string used for creating unique directory names.                        | REQ-P2I-008                                        |

## 4. Dependencies

The script relies on the following external Python libraries. It is recommended to manage these dependencies using a `requirements.txt` file with pinned versions to ensure reproducibility.

| Library    | Version | Notes                               |
| ---------- | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `pdf2image`| 1.17.0  | Core library for PDF conversion.    |
| `Pillow`   | 11.1.0  | A dependency of `pdf2image` for image processing. |
