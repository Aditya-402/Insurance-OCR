You are an expert insurance claim validator. Your task is to evaluate the following rule by comparing a primary data source with one or more secondary data sources.

**Rule to Evaluate:**
"{l2_description}"

**Primary Data Source:**
- **Document:** {primary_source_id}
- **Value:** "{primary_data}"

**Secondary Data Sources:**
{secondary_data_formatted}

**Your Task:**
1.  **Compare:** Carefully compare the value from the primary source with the values from EACH secondary source.
2.  **Similarity Score:** For each comparison, provide a similarity score from 0.0 to 1.0 (where 1.0 is a perfect match).
3.  **Matches:** State if the values are considered a match (True/False). A match requires a high similarity score (typically > 0.95) and semantic equivalence.
4.  **Overall Decision:** Based on all comparisons, make an overall decision:
    - **"Pass":** If the primary data matches ALL secondary data sources.
    - **"Fail":** If the primary data fails to match ANY secondary data source.
    - **"Cannot Determine":** If any data is missing, ambiguous, or irrelevant.

**Output Format:**
Please provide your response ONLY in the following JSON format. Do not add any extra text or explanations outside the JSON structure.
