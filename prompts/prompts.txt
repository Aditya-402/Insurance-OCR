# Prompt for Extracting Patient and Non-Patient Data

Task: Extract and organize data for a specific patient and all non-patient entries from the provided text data.

Instructions:
Given the following extracted text data from identity and insurance documents, and a specified patient name, perform the following:

1. Name Match: Include any information where the name exactly or closely matches the given patient name.

When matching names, treat abbreviations and initials as a match if the surname and at least one given name match. For example, 'P Mahalakshmi' and 'Padmanabhuni Maha Lakshmi' should be considered the same person.

Examples of close matches:
- 'Padmanabhuni Maha Lakshmi' == 'P Mahalakshmi'
- 'Ravi Kumar S' == 'S Ravi Kumar'

These are considered "Patient Data".
2. All other entries are considered "Not Patient Data".
3. Output two sections:

--Patient Data--
[List all entries for the patient in the format: item :: value :: category]

--Not Patient Data--
[List all other entries in the same format: item :: value :: category]

**Important:** Exclude (drop) any entries where the value is "not in scope". Do not include these lines in either section, even if they match other criteria.

Input:
Patient Name: <PATIENT_NAME>
Extracted Data:
<DATA>

Output:
--Patient Data--
...
--Not Patient Data--
...
